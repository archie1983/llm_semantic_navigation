The project relies on [AI2-THOR](https://github.com/allenai/ai2thor), [ProcTHOR-10k](https://github.com/allenai/procthor-10k) dataset and several LLMs:
* Llama3
* Mistral
* Gemma.

Please pull them before running this code. The required versions are specified in ae_llm.py where more can be added, but currently the following versions are used:

* [gemma:7b-instruct-v1.1-q6_K](https://ollama.com/library/gemma:7b-instruct-v1.1-q6_K)
* [mistral:7b-instruct-v0.2-q4_0](https://ollama.com/library/mistral:7b-instruct-v0.2-q4_0)
* [mistral:7b-instruct-v0.2-q6_K](https://ollama.com/library/mistral:7b-instruct-v0.2-q6_K)
* [llama3:8b-instruct-q6_K](https://ollama.com/library/llama3:8b-instruct-q6_K)

You must also install Thortils version from the referenced repository in the git submodule here. The vanilla Thortils will not work as I made several important changes. The best way to do that is to set up a conda environment for this purpose and install Thortils using:

```
git clone https://github.com/archie1983/llm_semantic_navigation
cd llm_semantic_navigation
git submodule init
git submodule update
cd thortils
pip install --no-cache-dir -e .
```

To demonstrate our approach, there are two main scripts:

**extract_scene_data.py** - for classifying a habitat from ProcTHOR-10k dataset. It will select next habitat with all 4 room types (**Kitchen**, **Living room**, **Bedroom**, **Bathroom**) from the training part of the dataset and then it will put the agent in random positions in that habitat and classify each random point belonging to a specific room- depending on objects observed around it.

**semantic_path_planner.py** - Uses the points classified by extract_scene_data.py to generate a path to an object of interest. It also plots the generated path on top of a top-view habitat image. I used this in the jupyter notebook "environment.ipynb" because running it from command line gave error: about xcb QT plugin that couldn't be started. I didn't have time to fix that, so ran it from jupyter notebook.

Finally **analyse_classification_results.ipynb** is where I analyzed test results and generated box plots.
**generate_and_evaluate_datasets.ipynb** is where I generated the SVC.

You will be given an object to look for and should provide guidance of where to explore based on a series of observations . Observations will be given as a list of object clusters numbered 1 to N .  Your job is to provide guidance about where we should explore next . For example if we are in a house and looking for a tv we should explore areas that typically have tv ’ s such as bedrooms and living rooms .  You should always provide reasoning along with a number identifying where we should explore . If there are multiple right answers you should separate them with commas . Always include Reasoning : < your reasoning > and Answer : < your answer ( s ) >. If there are no suitable answers leave the space afters Answer : blank .  Example User : I observe the following clusters of objects while exploring a house : 1. sofa , tv , speaker 2. desk , chair , computer 3. sink , microwave , refrigerator  Where should I search next if I am looking for a knife ?  Assistant : Reasoning : Knifes are typically kept in the kitchen and a sink , microwave , and refrigerator are commonly found in kitchens . Therefore we should check the cluster that is likely to be a kitchen first . Answer : 3  Other considerations  1. Disregard the frequency of the objects listed on each line . If there are multiple of the same item in a cluster it will only be listed once in that cluster . 2. You will only be given a list of common items found in the environment . You will not be given room labels . Use your best judgement when determining what room a cluster of objects is likely to belong to .\n"
